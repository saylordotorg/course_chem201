Remember that organic chemistry is the discipline that studies the
properties and reactions of organic, carbon-based compounds.  This
course is intended to be taken after the first two semesters of organic
chemistry.  Many of the topics within this outline have been covered in
the first two semesters of organic chemistry; however, this course will
explore these topics in much greater depth.  It is important to make
sure that you have a good grasp of the concepts from earlier organic
chemistry courses before moving on to this course. We begin by studying
a unit on ylides, benzyne, and free radicals.  Many free radicals affect
life processes.  For example, oxygen-derived radicals may be
overproduced in cells, such as white blood cells that try to defend
against infection in a living organism.  In the first unit, you will
learn about free radicals, including oxygen-containing compounds. 
Afterward we move into a comprehensive examination of stereochemistry,
as well as the kinetics of substitution and elimination reactions. 
After learning the information in that unit, you will be able to
describe reaction mechanisms.  The course wraps up with a final unit,
which is a survey of various hetereocyclic structures, including their
MO theory, aromaticity, and reactivity.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   Describe free radicals in terms of stability, kinetics, and bond
    dissociation energies.
-   Describe the stereochemistry and orbitals involved in photochemical
    reactions.
-   Describe enantiomers, diastereomers, pro-S and pro-R hydrogens, and
    Re/Si faces of carbonyls. 
-   Perform conformational analysis of alkanes and cyclohexanes.
-   Describe reaction mechanisms in terms of variousparameters
    (i.e.,kinetics, Curtin-Hammet principle, Hammond postulate,etc.).
-   Describe the chemistry of the heterocycles listed in Unit 3in terms
    of molecular orbital theory, aromaticity, and reactions.

### Course Information

Welcome to CHEM 201.  Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.  

**Course Designer:** [Rachel
Lerebours](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-h-n/#DrRachelLerebours)

**Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of free online
materials.  However, the course primarily makes use of the following
materials:

-   University of Calgary: Professor Ian Hunt’s “[Organic
    Chemistry](http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/courses/351/Carey5th/Carey.html)”
-   Michigan State University: Professor William Reusch’s “[Virtual
    Textbook of Organic
    Chemistry”](http://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/VirtTxtJml/intro1.htm#contnt)
-   Metropolitan State College of Denver: Professor Milton Weider’s
    “[Advanced Organic
    Chemistry](http://clem.mscd.edu/~wiederm/advorgppt/)”

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
 You will also need to complete the Final Exam.  In order to “pass” this
course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on the FinalExam.  Your
score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If you
do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of **60 hours**
to complete. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount
of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help
you plan your time accordingly.  Please look at the time advisories
prior to starting the course to determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete eachunit.

**Tips/Suggestions: **This is a very difficult course, so allow time to
“digest” the material. When needed, review relevant information from the
prerequisite courses.  Take plenty of notes and review daily.

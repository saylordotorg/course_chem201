**Unit 1: Reactive Reaction Intermediates** <span id="1"></span> 
*A reaction intermediate is a short-lived compound that is generated in
a chemical reaction.  These intermediates are very important because
their isolation, though difficult, can provide very important insight
into the mechanism of the reaction.  When the intermediate cannot be
isolated, evidence of its existence can be seen through spectroscopic
methods. *  
              
 *In this unit,we* *study the chemistry behind some of the important
reaction intermediates. We will first discuss ylides, their preparation,
and reactions.  We will then study benzynes, and finally we will discuss
free radicals.*

**1.3 Free Radicals** <span id="1.3"></span> 
*A radical is an unpaired electron that arises from homolytical cleavage
of a chemical bond.  Free radicals are extremely important for many
reactions and life processes, such as the function of our immune
systems.  When your body is attacked by foreign invaders, your immune
system recognizes this through free radicals, and therefore, it is able
to defend against the attack.  The introduction to this course mentions
how white blood cells, which overproduce oxygen-based free radicals,
defend against infection.*  
    
 *Note: Free radicals are an example of homolytic bond cleavage, as*
*you learned in* *your previous organic chemistry course.  Here, we go
into more detail about radicals, their bond dissociation energies, and
the mechanisms of radicals.*

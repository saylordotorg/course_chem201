**Unit 2: Stereochemistry and Reaction Mechanisms** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Many of these topics will be a review from the first two semesters of
organic chemistry.  However, you will look deeper into stereochemistry
with topics such as pro-s and pro-r hydrogens, re/si faces of carbonyls,
along with the relationship of reacticity and stereochemistry.  This
unit will cover sections on reaction mechanisms, including kinetics (the
study of chemical reaction rates).*

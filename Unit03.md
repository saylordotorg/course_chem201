**Unit 3: Organometallics and Heterocycles** <span id="3"></span> 
*Remember that organometallics is the study of metals bonded to
nonmetals, and there is an overlap of studying organometallics in both
organic and inorganic chemistry.  In* *your previous organic chemistry*
*courses, you have seen organometallic reagents in the form of
Grignards, metal hydrides,* *and so forth.  Here, we will discuss
organometallics more in depth, more specifically as carbon
nucleophiles.  We will then examine the classes of organic heterocyclic
compounds, which are compounds that contain at least two different
elements as ring-member atoms. *
